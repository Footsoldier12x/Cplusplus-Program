e# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The program prompts the user for input and performs a task depending on that input:
  
  1. Produce a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased.
  2. Produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day.
  3. Produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased.
  4. Exit Program.
  
  This information will help a store to arrange the produce items that are sold the most in an effective way to reach their customers.

# What did you do particularly well?
  There were a few improvements that I included that were not in the assignment prompt, for example: 
  * The program continues running after invalid input has been entered and prompts user to try again, instead of forcing an early exiting or crashing.
  * The user can enter the name of an item all lowercase, uppercase, or capitalized and the program will still work.
  * Instead of reading the file every time C++ calls a Python method, I read and stored the file contents into a dictionary as a global variable, and most of the other tasks     are derived from information in that dictionary. This saves the user from reading the file every time they want to perform a task.
  
# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I think the structure of the program can use improvement. I have learned a lot about how to perform many different tasks, but the way my code is organized
  could benefit from more specific guidelines.
  
# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  The Python portion of the code was the most challenging because it has been a little while since I have used it. I had to go back to one of my older Zybooks and
  online to find how to write certain portions of my code, like how to capitalize a word, format output, read, and write files. Additionally, I ventured into the documentation
  for C++ and Python, where I was able to find very good examples of how code is implemented.
  
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  Utilizing text files to integrate programs or applications that were not necessarily meant communicate will be useful. I thought most linking would be done by writing
  complex code, however, communication between languages can be done in other creative ways. Keeping an open mind to use out-of-the-box methods to link programs will 
  definitely help me in the future.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I added many comments to explain my thought process so that anyone else reading them would be able to see what each portion of the program is doing.
  That way if any changes need to be made, the next programmer can read my code and make those adjustments.
